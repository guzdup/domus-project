# domus-project
Domus is a web page created in React, focusing on real estate, where users can browse through different properties available for purchase. <br> Developed with the goal of learning React, this project showcases my journey in mastering the React library, providing a valuable resource for individuals in search of their ideal property. With a user-friendly interface and intuitive design, Domus offers a seamless experience for those seeking their dream home or investment opportunity. 

Domus is purely a demo site and properties cannot be purchased through this platform. ;)

The project can be found in the **develop** branch.
